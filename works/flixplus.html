        <h3>Web Development: "FlixPlus"</h3>
          <p>
            FlixPlus is a group task by PANDABOYZ during our Work Immersion in Grade 12. We created a Movie Recommendation Website that also functions as a forum for every movie enjoyer to
            participate on.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><b>When: </b>2023</p>
          <p><b>Method: </b>React, Bootstrap</p>
          <p><b>Role: </b>Front-End and Back-End Developer</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our group was divided into 2, Front-Ends and Back-Ends. I was part of the Front-End group (with the Back-Ends having different task) but our task also involves back-end.</p>
          <p>
            The idea behind FlixPlus is that we were asked by the Interns what type of website we would like to create in learning React and Bootstrap. We all agreed to make a website about Movies.
            The website's navigation is functional but it was never launched online. We used Git and Github to work separately on different parts of the website and was able to run the website locally.
            Sadly, our Work Immersion ended before we can fully complete the website.
